"Ah, the wind whispers of your coming, brave adventurer! How may Old Gregg assist you today?"
"Thou shalt not pass... without first enjoying a cup of Gnomebrew Coffee. Perks you right up!"
"Hail, hero! The kingdom's salvation lies in... Hey, are you even listening? Stop checking your inventory!"
"A dragon terrorizes the lands. Oh, you've heard that one before?"
"Fear not, hero! Take this sword, it's dangerous to go alone! Also, it's 50% off today."
"In your quest, you must consult the Oracle of Delphi...or Dave, the guy who knows stuff."
"Welcome to the Enchanted Forest, where the trees are 100% organic and the unicorns are gluten-free."
"May the RNG gods forever be in your favor."
"Ah, another wanderer looking to buy some potions. Just don't ask what's in them."
"You wish to defeat the Demon Lord? First, you must conquer the deadliest foe: server lag."
"Y'arrr, what be ye doin' in these parts? Ah, treasure hunting, I see. Well, X marks the spot... or was it Y?"
"Mages get your staffs, warriors get your swords, and rogues, just... go stand in the corner."
"You have been granted the Sword of Eternal Power! But first, would you like to take a survey?"
"Do you wish to hear a tale of valor and sacrifice? Too late, it's DLC content."
"Our kingdom is in peril! But first, let's take a selfie."
"To defeat your enemies, you must know them, train hard, and also buy some premium gems."
"You say you're here to save the realm? Didn't you also say that last week?"
"Before you proceed, hero, please read our terms of service."
"Good to see you, hero! Or should I say... cash cow?"
"The end is near! But it's not too late to buy some in-game merchandise."
"Welcome, adventurer, to the dungeon of doom! Not to be confused with the dungeon of gloom, that's two doors down."
"The princess is in another castle... but she left her Snapchat, so it's not a total loss."
"You must collect the seven artifacts of power! And maybe some milk on your way back?"
"The orcs have a saying: 'Die with honor, respawn with more loot.'"
"In ancient times, dragons roamed these lands. Now it's mostly just influencers and food bloggers."
"Seek the Old Wise Man at the mountain peak. He shall... wait, you're googling a walkthrough, aren't you?"
"Ah, traveler! You've returned with the Elixir of Eternal Life, eh?"
"Verily, you've conquered the Mountain of Despair! Here's 50 gold coins."
"Life is suffering. Have you considered that in your quest for the Sword of Destiny?"
"Welcome to the Guild of Forgotten Souls! Now, what's your damage?"
"OMG, you guys! This dungeon is sooo lit! #BestDungeonEver"
"It's-a me! Are you ready to jump into the next adventure?"
"You shall not pass, unless you solve my riddle!"
"What is better? To be born good, or to overcome your evil nature through great effort?"
"Life, which you so nobly serve, comes from destruction, disorder and chaos."
"Yo, fam! Don't forget to like and subscribe before you head to the Dark Forest!"
"I'm sooo over the Fire Kingdom. It's just too mainstream now."
"It was the best of times, it was the worst of quests."
"To defeat your enemies, you must know them. Even if they are mushrooms!"
"Mastering others is strength; mastering yourself is true power."
"So you're an adventurer? Isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?"
"We make a special deal for you, only today, only now: Buy one health potion, get one free!"
"You either die a hero or live long enough to become an NPC."
"The unexamined quest is not worth grinding."
"I think you're in the wrong game, but hey, as long as you're having fun!"
"There is always some madness in leveling up. But there is also always some reason in madness."
"The essence of combat: kill, or be killed."
"Woe be to the adventurer who opens Pandora's Loot Box."
"Welcome, welcome! Do you come often? No, really, how often?"
"To be or not to be, that is the quest."
"Ain't no rest for the wicked. Money don't grow on trees, you know!"
"Ah, sweet child of Kos, returned to the waking world, have we?"
"Let's make a deal, you and I. One you simply can't refuse."
"Whoa! You just hit level 20? That's sooo aesthetic! #LevelUpGoals"
"The cake is a lie, but the XP is real!"
"The night is dark and full of side quests."
"Existence precedes essence. So, what's your next quest, existentialist?"
"Enemies ahead? I can take 'em!"
"You are not prepared... for these discounts! All potions 50% off!"
"I'm not great at advice, but can I interest you in a sarcastic comment?"
"To conquer oneself is a greater victory than to conquer thousands in a battle."
"Why do today what you can put off for tomorrow? Actually, the Dragon won't slay itself."
"Time you enjoy wasting on this game was not wasted time."
"In this world, it's grind or be grinded!"
"Boss ahead? 'Tis but a scratch!"
"He who fights with monsters should be careful lest he thereby become a monster. And if you grind too long, the grind also grinds you."
"Trust is for fools! Gold is all that matters here."
"It is not the strength of the body that counts, but the strength of the spirit."
"Ugh! Could you BE any slower in finishing this quest?"
"New to the realm? Swipe up for an exclusive tutorial!"
"Hey, listen! You should really stock up on potions before the next fight."
"Beyond this gate lies the Abyss. Bring a sweater, it gets chilly."
"Welcome, adventurer, to the Caverns of Eternal Sorrow. Happy hour is from 4 to 6."
"The only thing we have to grind is grinding itself."
"I'm not in the mood for chat, unless it's a dialogue tree."
"Howdy, partner. Ready to saddle up for another bounty?"
"Today's forecast: Cloudy with a chance of dragon attacks."
"Look in the mirror... that's your only competition in this game."
"If you can't handle me at my worst, you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best stats."
"Fortune favors the bold. But XP favors the grinder."
"Two things are infinite: the universe and the respawn timer; and I'm not sure about the universe."
"A horse, a horse, my lootbox for a horse!"
"What's up, heroes! Use code 'EPICQUEST' for 10% off your next in-game purchase!"
"Ain't no party like a dungeon crawl party 'cause a dungeon crawl party don't stop until everyone's encumbered."
"Man is the cruelest animal. Especially in PvP."
"I feel the need—the need for speed (potions)!"
"The course of true love never did run smooth. But then again, neither does lag."
"One does not simply walk into the End Zone."
"Hey, wanna see something cool? Press Alt+F4!"
"In three words I can sum up what I've learned about life in the realm: It goes on."
"Between the idea and the reality, between the potion and the effect, falls the lag."
"Behind every avatar is a player with a snack."
"Be yourself; everyone else is already grinding."
"Do not dwell in the past, do not dream of the future, concentrate the mind on the present game."
"Ah, you've come this far, only to die at the hands of the King of Shadows! But first, how was your day?"
"Never look a gift dragon in the mouth. Actually, never look any dragon in the mouth."
"It's dangerous to go alone! Take this loot drop."
"When it's us vs. them, always bet on us. Unless they're higher level."
"Y'know, in another universe, you and I are just polygons and pixels."
"Come at me, bro. But only if you've read the Terms of Service."
"Existential dread got you down? Try our new Existential Bread—freshly baked in-game!"
"It's not the size of the sword, it's how you swing it!"
"Adventurer, your future is whatever you grind it to be."
